# Results and Analysis

We are gradually adding summaries of our results to these web pages (please let us know if you would like other comparisons). These summaries also include a table of results along with links to the configuration and results of each individual run. We detail our [methodology for our measurements here](/gunrock/methodology).

- [Gunrock performance compared with other engines for graph analytics](/analysis/engines_topc)
- [Setting parameters for direction-optimized BFS](http://gunrock.github.io/gunrock/doc/latest/md_stats_do_ab_random)
- [Gunrock results on different GPUs](/analysis/gunrock_gpus)
- [Gunrock BFS throughput as a function of frontier size](/analysis/frontier_size)
- [Multi-GPU Gunrock Speedups](/analysis/mgpu_speedup) and [Multi-GPU Gunrock Scalability](/analysis/mgpu_scalability)
- [Multi-GPU Gunrock Partition Performance](/analysis/groute)

For reproducibility, we maintain Gunrock configurations and results in our github [gunrock/io](https://github.com/gunrock/io/tree/master/gunrock-output) repository.

We are happy to run experiments with other engines, particularly if those engines output results in our JSON format / a format that can be easily parsed into JSON format.
