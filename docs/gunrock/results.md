# Results and Analysis

We are gradually adding summaries of our results to these web pages (please let us know if you would like other comparisons). These summaries also include a table of results along with links to the configuration and results of each individual run. We detail our [methodology for our measurements here](https://gunrock.github.io/docs/#methodology).

- [Gunrock performance compared with other engines for graph analytics](https://gunrock.github.io/docs/engines_topc.html)
- [Setting parameters for direction-optimized BFS](http://gunrock.github.io/gunrock/doc/latest/md_stats_do_ab_random.html)
- [Gunrock results on different GPUs](https://gunrock.github.io/docs/gunrock_gpus.html)
- [Gunrock BFS throughput as a function of frontier size](https://gunrock.github.io/docs/frontier.html)
- [Multi-GPU Gunrock Speedups](https://gunrock.github.io/docs/mgpu_speedup.html) and [Multi-GPU Gunrock Scalability](https://gunrock.github.io/docs/mgpu_scalability.html)
- [Multi-GPU Gunrock Partition Performance](https://gunrock.github.io/docs/mgpu_partition.html)
- [Comparison to Groute](http://gunrock.github.io/docs/groute.html)

For reproducibility, we maintain Gunrock configurations and results in our github [gunrock/io](https://github.com/gunrock/io/tree/master/gunrock-output) repository.

We are happy to run experiments with other engines, particularly if those engines output results in our JSON format / a format that can be easily parsed into JSON format.
