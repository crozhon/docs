# Road Map

We have three principal near-term priorities for Gunrock development (as of June 2019):

-   Gunrock's 1.0 release focused on single-GPU performance. We expect to target single-node multi-GPU support in a near-term future release.

-   We believe dynamic (mutable) graphs are a practically interesting area of graph analytics that has not been a focus of the GPU graph analytics research community.

-   We will ensure that Gunrock will integrate with NVIDIA's [RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai/) suite of software libraries to accelerate data science workloads on GPUs.

We also continue to pursue projects in scalability (within a node, across nodes, and across the CPU-GPU boundary); in programmability, including working with the MIT [GraphIt](http://graphit-lang.org/) team; in improving Gunrock's internals, both their performance and their modularity; in expanding the number and coverage of applications written in Gunrock; and in better interoperability with other tools, languages, and libraries.
